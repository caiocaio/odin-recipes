        <h1>Real Italian Calzones</h1>
        <img src="../img/calzone.jpg" alt="calzone">

        <p>These calzones are the real deal because there is no tomato sauce inside! 
            We eat them at least once a week. 
            Have a bowl of tomato or spaghetti sauce on the table 
            for people to top their calzone if desired</p>

            <h2>What Is a Calzone? </h2>

        <p>A calzone is a savory Italian turnover. 
            It traditionally consists of a cheesy filling in a leavened dough 
            and is served with marinara sauce on the side. 
            The calzone originated in Naples in the 18th-century. </p>

            <h3>Calzone vs. Stromboli</h3>

        <p>Although “calzone” and “stromboli” are often used interchangeably, 
            the two dishes are actually quite different. Here’s how: </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Calzones have Italian origins and are sealed with a fork. The sauce is traditionally served on the side. </li>
                <li>Stromboli, meanwhile, originated in the U.S. and are rolled into a spiral. The sauce is usually included in the filling. </li>
            </ul>

                <h2>Ingredients</h2>

                <h3>Dough:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 (.25 ounce) package active dry yeast</li>
                <li>1 cup warm water</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
                <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Filling:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 ½ cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
                <li>½ cup ricotta cheese</li>
                <li>½ cup diced pepperoni</li>
                <li>½ cup sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon dried basil leaves</li>
            </ul>

           <h3>Directions</h3>

           <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>Make dough: Dissolve yeast in warm water in a mixing bowl; let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon oil, sugar, and salt; mix in 1 cup flour until smooth. Gradually stir in remaining flour until dough is smooth and workable.</p>

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead dough until it is elastic, about 5 minutes. Place 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large bowl; lay dough in the bowl and flip to coat with oil. Cover and let rise until almost doubled in size, about 40 minutes.</p>

            <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>Meanwhile, make the filling: Combine Cheddar cheese, ricotta cheese, pepperoni, mushrooms, and basil leaves in a medium bowl. Mix well, cover, and refrigerate to chill.</p>
            
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet.</p>

            <h4>Step 5</h4>
                <p>Punch down dough; divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece out on a lightly floured surface into 1/8-inch-thick circles. Fill each circle with 1/2 of the cheese and meat filling.</p>

            <h4>Step 6</h4>
                <p>Fold dough over filling to make a semicircle. Press edges down with the tines of a fork to seal. Brush the top of each calzone with beaten egg and place on the prepared baking sheet.</p>

            <h4>Step 7</h4>
                <p>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. Serve hot.</p>
