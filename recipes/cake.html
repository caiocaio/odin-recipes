        <h1>Pumpkin-Black Cocoa Swirl Cake</h1>
        <img src="../img/cake.jpg" alt="cake">

        <p>This strikingly delicious pumpkin-black cocoa swirl Bundt cake packs a 
            flavor punch thanks to black cocoa. 
            Not only does it make for a wonderfully dark color, 
            but it also adds a flavor reminiscent of Oreo cookies!</p>

                <li>1 cup confectioner's sugar</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons black cocoa powder</li>

                <li>6 tablespoons heavy cream, or as needed</li>
            </ul>

           <h3>Directions</h3>

           <h4>Step 1</h4>
                <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Spray a 12-cup Bundt pan with a baking spray containing flour, such as Baker's Joy®.</p>

            <h4>Step 2</h4>
                <p>In a large bowl, sift together flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.</p>

            <h4>Step 3</h4>
                <p>In another large bowl, beat butter, oil, and 2 cups white sugar on medium-high speed with an electric mixer until creamy, about 3 minutes. Add in eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each addition. After adding in the last egg, beat mixture on medium-high speed until doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Add in pumpkin and vanilla, and mix until incorporated. Reduce mixer speed to low; pour in half of dry ingredients, and mix until just combined. Add in sour cream; mix until just combined. Add in remaining dry ingredients and mix until just combined.</p>
            
            <h4>Step 4</h4>
                <p>Measure out 3 cups batter into another bowl. To this 3 cups batter, add 3 tablespoon black cocoa powder, unsweetened cocoa powder, 2 tablespoons sugar, milk, espresso powder, and melted semi-sweet chocolate. Mix on low speed until combined.</p>

            <h4>Step 5</h4>
                <p>Place 1/3 of black cocoa batter into an even layer in the bottom of the prepared Bundt pan. Pour 1/2 of plain pumpkin batter over the black cocoa layer. Add another 1/3 of black cocoa batter over the top of plain pumpkin batter. Layer remaining 1/2 of plain pumpkin batter over that. Finish with remaining 1/3 of the black cocoa batter.</p>

            <h4>Step 6</h4>
                <p>Bake cake in the preheated oven until a bamboo skewer inserted into the center of the cake comes out mostly clean, 60 to 65 minutes. Allow cake to cool in pan 25 to 30 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

            <h4>Step 7</h4>
                <p>To make icing, place powdered sugar, 2 tablespoons black cocoa, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract, pinch of salt, and heavy cream into a bowl. Whisk until smooth. Drizzle icing over cooled cake.</p>
